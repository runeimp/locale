This Go package exists for it's numbers formatter use by <http://github.com/runeimp/ballistic>. I created it because I did not know about `golang.org/x/text` at the time and like researching things like i18n and l10n and was currious about the diversity of the world's numbering formats. So until `ballistic` switches to something else like `golang.org/x/text` I have this package.

It is not a complete i18n or l10n solution at this point and will likely never be unless `golang.org/x/text` languishes and there is no other suitable replacement.

See more about `golang.org/x/text`:
